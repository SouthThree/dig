the PartialIncrement5 takes a long time for generating rand inputs
For random inputs, may be favor positive ones 

min/max plus:  ignore all octagonals,  ignore anything that only has inp vars

8/2
- From traces: need mpp,  need floating point support (right now just int)


5/21
- write traces to tmpdir .. done
- read traces from tmpdir, (re)infer invariants
- WeakMPP code from old DIG
- Dig issue



- New Idea: Pure Dynamic analysis on Traces
- NEw idea: CEGIR on *traces*
- NEw idea: Prepost conds
- New idea: Max/Min plus
- New idea: work on class file, incremental symbolic states ?
