- Egcd2_bound seems to run a long time for solving equations.  Need to run with -maxdeg 2.  Suggestion: look at the traces and equations.
12/30
Todo:
- super z3 simplify symbolic state
- set a bound on input value values  (use CILL to do this)

the PartialIncrement5 takes a long time for generating rand inputs
For random inputs, may be favor positive ones 

min/max plus:  ignore all octagonals,  ignore anything that only has inp vars

8/2
- From traces: need mpp,  need floating point support (right now just int)


5/21
- write traces to tmpdir .. done
- read traces from tmpdir, (re)infer invariants
- WeakMPP code from old DIG
- Dig issue



- New Idea: Pure Dynamic analysis on Traces
- NEw idea: CEGIR on *traces*
- NEw idea: Prepost conds
- New idea: Max/Min plus
- New idea: work on class file, incremental symbolic states ?
